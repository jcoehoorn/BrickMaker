 There is debate over this.
 Some people say 1.8, some say 1.7, and some say one lego unit (1.6).
 I believe actual lego studs are 1.8, *but this includes the "lego" emboss.*
 Thus, a more practical default printing height is 1.7.
 So, since we also have a height adjustment defaulted to .1,

       Since these posts are 1LU, and studs are 3LU, 
       it's tempting to just use 1/3 that.
       However, I believe it's about area, rather than radius here.

       using un-adjusted posts, and 1xN bricks fit
       better than almost anything else I print. 
       I may put an adjustment back in the future if people ask for it.
